<p>• Combats climate change: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, and store it as they grow. This helps to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p>
 
<p>• Improves air quality: Trees act as natural filters, removing dust, pollutants, and harmful gases from the air we breathe. </p>

<p>• Reduces stormwater runoff: Trees slow down the flow of rainwater, allowing it to soak into the ground instead of running off and causing erosion.</p>

<p>• Provides wildlife habitat: Trees provide food and shelter for a variety of animals, birds, and insects.</p>

<p>• Lowers energy costs: Trees can help to cool buildings in the summer and provide wind protection in the winter, reducing energy consumption for heating and cooling.</p>

<p>• Beautifies communities: Trees add beauty and character to our neighborhoods and cities.</p>

<p>• Improves mental and physical health: Studies have shown that spending time in nature can reduce stress, improve mood, and boost overall health.</p>

<p>• Provides food and resources: Many trees produce fruits, nuts, and other edible items that can be a valuable source of food and income.</p>


<p>Planting trees is a relatively simple activity that can have a big impact. So why not get involved in a tree planting event or plant a tree in your own yard? You'll be making a positive contribution to the environment and your community.</p>
